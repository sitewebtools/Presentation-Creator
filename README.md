# AiPPT – Presentation Creator Resource Library

AiPPT is a presentation creation project that explores how artificial intelligence can assist with structuring ideas, organizing content, and designing presentation-ready outlines.

This repository serves as an **open knowledge base and prompt library** for building professional presentations across business, academic, and creative scenarios.

## Project Purpose

Creating effective presentations requires both clear thinking and structured communication.  
AiPPT focuses on the **content and logic layer** of presentations, helping users:

- Turn raw ideas into structured slide outlines
- Apply proven presentation frameworks
- Reuse prompts and templates across scenarios

This repository emphasizes **methodology, structure, and examples**, not commercial tooling.
